# FullstackOpen-Part3

This is a separate repository for the continuation of the FullstackOpen repository specifically for Part 3 (which requires a separate repo), which focuses towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack I wil implement a simple REST API in Node js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, I will deploy my application to the internet.
